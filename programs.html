				<h2>Graph Theoretical and Computational Analysis of Diabetic Disease Network for
Identifying New Drug Targets against Diabetes</h2>

				<p>Biological network analysis reveals useful hidden information in a very short time span compared to wet lab experiments. In this project, diabetes disease network will be analyzed with the help of mathematical, computational and network based tools. Type II diabetes is becoming major health concern worldwide. There are many factor associated with this disease like developmental, genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle, obesity etc. though it is a metabolic disorder disease caused by mainly insulin resistance and to some extent impaired insulin production. Different network parameters like network density, diameter, degree distribution, network heterogeneity, shortest pathlength etc. and topology will be analyzed for better understanding of network structural property. Eventually structural property will help in understanding network functionality as function is always affected by structure. Candidate genes, proteins or molecules will be identified using different centrality measures like, Degree centrality, Betweenness centrality, Closeness centrality, Eccentricity centrality, Eigenvector centrality. Genes, proteins or molecules will be ranked based on these centrality values. Pagerank algorithm also will be used in ranking. These top ranked gene, protein or molecule will be tested for drugability. Motifs are also known as subgraphs and will be used to identify the structural design principles of the network. If there is any change in genetic pattern, it can be identified by aligning diabetic network with non diabetic network. It will help in understanding the emergent of diabetic network .</p>

				<h2>Predicting protein functional sites using machine learning approaches</h2>

				<p>Proteins execute and coordinate cellular functions by interacting with other biomolecules that help in life sustenance. In order to use the fundamental knowledge of protein functions for industrial or medical applications such as in protein engineering and drug design, it is essential that they be understood in detail. Identification and characterization of functional sites is an important step towards this end. These sites often comprise of residues that bind with ligands, participate in catalysis etc. However, because the occurrence of these sites is very few as compared to their counterpart, their accurate identification has been challenging. Knowledge guided intuitive approaches such as machine learning could aid rapid and robust identification of protein functional sites. It can be done, provided the nature of imbalance in data is addressed adequately.</p>
				<p>Machine learning approaches have gained popularity in this context for developing ab initio methods of protein functional site prediction. Here biological properties are encoded appropriately in a computational architecture for predictions. In this project biological data analysis and processing leading to the development of predictive models for prediction of protein functional sites using machine learning is proposed.</p>

				<h2>Predictability of infectious diseases using mathematical modeling</h2>

				<br>
				<p>A mathematical model is an explicit mathematical description of the simplified dynamics of a system. Using mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, disease infection patterns can be simulated for the development of various health management strategies. Since the infectious diseases are sometimes sporadic and often difficult to control, knowledge guided intuitive approaches such as mathematical modeling could aid in developing an understanding for infection management and eradication. One popular model used in the modelling of infectious diseases by computing the amount of people in a closed population at a given period of time, is the SIR model (Susceptible (S) -> Infectious (I) -> Recovered (R)). The model and its derivatives can be used for explaining the increase and decrease in people needing medical care for a certain disease during an epidemic. From numbers generated by the SIR model researcherâ€™s health officials can calculate different numbers that allow them to see if policies are effective and if occurrence of the disease is increasing, decreasing, or stable. In this project infectious disease data analysis and processing leading to the development of predictive approaches using the SIR model and its derivatives is proposed. Findings of the study are hoped to help determine the plausibility of epidemiological explanations, possibly predict unexpected interrelationships among empirical observations and help predict the impact of changes in the infectious disease system under consideration.</p>
